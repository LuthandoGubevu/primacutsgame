## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a warm, earthy brown (#A0522D) reminiscent of natural tones.
- Background color: Light sand (#F8F4E3), provides a neutral backdrop, preventing distraction.
- Accent color: A slightly darker, analogous brown (#8B4513) to accent key elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Tap target icon: Placeholder meatstick.png (80x80 pixels), designed for easy tap recognition.
- Responsive design to adapt smoothly to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Use a simple animation style like 'ease-out' on the icon fade after being tapped. Avoid complex or distracting effects.
